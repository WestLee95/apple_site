# 🍎 Apple Site Clone – In Progress

## 📸 Sneak Peek

![Apple Site Clone Screenshot](./image/Screenshot.png)

Hey! Welcome to the repo for my Apple-inspired site – a pixel-perfect, front-end clone in the making. This project is all about replicating the elegance, smooth animations, and modern UI style you'd expect from a brand like Apple… but built entirely from scratch using clean HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript.

## 🚧 Project Status: Work In Progress

This isn't the final show yet — expect updates, improvements, and plenty of polish coming soon. Animations, scroll effects, mobile responsiveness, and accessibility are all in the roadmap.

So far, we've got:
- ✅ Initial layout and structure
- ✅ Responsive navbar setup
- ✅ Hero section mockup
- 🛠️ Animations and scroll effects (in progress)
- 🧪 Cross-browser and device testing coming up next
